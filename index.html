<h1>Ember‑Lit Trials Index</h1>
<p>
  In the Ember‑Lit Realm and beyond, nothing important happens without a trial.  
  This index gathers the key Ember‑Lit Trials that shape Beast, Brinrose, and the Wolf Dragon Phoenix saga—each one a different way of asking:
  <em>Who are you when the spiral tightens?</em>

<h2>How the Trials Interlock</h2>
<p class="small-note">
  These trials aren’t a straight staircase. They loop. They repeat.  
  Silence leads to remembrance. Remembrance leads back to breath.  
  Balance makes space for rhythm. Rhythm holds room for naming.  
  Every time Beast steps into one trial, the others flare at the edges.
